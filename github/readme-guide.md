# How to write a great readme
[Back to main guide](../README.md)

Every repository should have a should `README.md`, this is displayed whenever someone looks at your repository and it really an introduction to your work. Having a readme with incomplete or very little information will leave a bad impression to those viewing your work. Think of this as the the first impression, just like meeting an interviewer for the first time, first impressions are critical.

There are a few key things that should be present in every readme:
* A one line description of what the repository is
* Brief explanation of what the app is and does.
* A link to to the live site
* Installation / setup to run the application locally
* Discussion of technologies that are used in the project
* Discuss in further detail two or three features you have built that showoff your technical abilities as well as any difficult challenges that were faced
* Highlighting one or two code snippets can be nice where applicable. It is always best to ensure these are code snippets and not images
