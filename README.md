# Guide
Iâ€™m writing this to help answer some of the many questions people have about being prepared for getting their first software engineering job. There is a lot to unpack to making yourself an ideal candidate. There is no perfect answer to being the ideal candidate but these will without doubt help you become a more attractive candidate. There are portions of this that will not apply to everyone, it is important to know, missing any section of this by itself will probably not be what makes or breaks you getting your first job.

## School / Internships
**Internships**

Making sure to get internships throughout your college career is a hugely impactful on getting your first job. In many cases internships will often lead to being offered jobs, but even when it does not, having these on your resume will make a world of difference. Especially for internships, having a solid understanding of data structures will make a big difference in getting those internships. There are a wide range of great resources available to help ensure you have the fundamentals down for any internship interviews but below are a few exceptional standout ones to start with:

* [MIT Open Courseware - Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
* [Stanford - Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycsalgorithms1-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-1)
* [Stanford - Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycs0001-algorithms-design-and-analysis-part-2)

This whole repository is geared towards people who want to be prepared as far in advance as possible, it may go without saying but its important identify and apply to internships as early as possible and make sure you have backups.

**Bootcamps**

Bootcamps have been a very touchy subject for many. There are people who think very poorly about them and those who sing their praises, without getting into debate about this, it is for many a viable option to change careers. There are far more low quality than high quality bootcamps out there but those which are strong will set you up for success. Truth be told, a strong bootcamp will provide you will all of the information found within this repository.

**Paid bootcamps**
* [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/referral_redirect?hash=04dbc105c59f04bb)
* [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/)
  
**Free bootcamps(self-taught)**
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [App Academy Online Open](https://open.appacademy.io)
* [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

For those who are taking an alternative route such as a coding bootcamp or self-taught, do not fret, there are tons of candidates who are able to get jobs without a degree from a university or a single internship under their belt.

#### FAQ
**I did not get an internship for x year, is this going to ruin my chances of getting my desired FAANG job?**

Not getting an internship is in no way a death sentence for getting your dream job. There are people who have had no internships on their resume who will get a dream job offer. Whats important to focus on is what is in your control. That is how you spend your time that you do not have an internship. Take the time to build out your portfolio, spec out and build a small full stack project, a library, a light-weight testing framework. Anything to demonstrate what you are capable of will make a world of difference in being an appealing candidate.
 
## Github / Portfolio
#### [Full-stack projects](/github/fullstack-projects.md)
#### [How to write a good readme](/github/readme-guide.md)
One of the biggest challenges a lot of college candidates seem to lack and bootcamp graduates tend to have more of, is a github profile with what looks more like real world experience. Having some relevant full stack applications to show a potential employer will leave them much more confident in your abilities and will definitely help you get call backs when applying to jobs. An in-depth primer of picking a good project can be found [here](/github/fullstack-projects.md).

It is important to realize that having a good github profile is not simple about having a few random repositories thrown up. Engineers who will be looking through candidates profiles will have a few things that immediately jump out to them. A well crafted README is very important, you can read more about that [here](/github/readme-guide.md).

You also want to make sure you are demonstrating your ability to use `git` properly. A lot of times when reviewing a candidates portfolio I will see a fully complete project and every file was committed at completion. You will see `Initial commit.` as the only commit in the repository. This in itself is not something that would stop someone from being hired but it is an immediate signal that they are using git purely to display their work and leaves the question if they have any experience using git properly. Committing your work as you go is a good touch to demonstrate your understanding. Free code camp has a [great article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/) on making great commit messages.

#### FAQ
<b>How do I choose which language or framework to get the best job?</b>

Languages and choice of framework do not matter that much contrary to what some may believe. Your ability to understand a language / framework is much more important than
the specific ones chosen. There will always be employers who will prefer to see you using
the language they use but that alone should not leave you paralyzed with what choice to make. You are better off picking something you find interesting and might enjoy. 

## Interview Prep
Preparing for the interviews is an extremely important process and is not something that can be left until the last minute. People prepare for many months before applying to jobs, there are whole industries surrounding helping prepare for the interview process. In many cases the technical interview questions asked are questions that address topics you will not be dealing with on a day to day in your job; however, they still serve a purpose to get to see how your logical brain works, how you work through problems and somewhat are aimed to ensure you learned the types of things expected from a standard CS degree.

## Applying to jobs
A lot of people tend to get very discouraged by not hearing back from any jobs. There are tons of posts around the internet if they should give up. Applying to jobs can be very discouraging and difficult but you need to keep in mind that it is really a numbers game. If you are a top tier candidate, who is checking off all the boxes of everything listed above and you are not hearing back from places that can be tough but just realize this is really like a marketing funnel. If we start with an offer and say for every offer you need to have 4 on-site interviews and for every onsite interview you need to have done 2 phone screens. And lastly to get each phone screen you need to send out 100 applications, doing some simple math 1 offer = 4 * 2 * 100 that would  be somewhere around 800 applications.

Do not be discouraged by the lack of hearing back! Do make sure you have all everything prepared before applying to maximize your chances. It really will feel like you will never get a job but you will. Learn from any mistakes you make, if you are having terrible luck evaluate what you can do better, where your knowledge gaps are and continue to apply.
